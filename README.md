Instructions



The Memory Game is an interactive version of the classic memory games where a player attempts to find all matching cards in the deck. When all the cards are found, the game is won.


Instructions

Begin the game by clicking one of the cards in the deck, then another. If the two cards match, they will remain open and be logged as one of the player's matching sets. If the cards do not match, they will flip over. When all eight matches are found, the game is won and the player will be alerted. A moves counter at the top of the screen tracks the player's moves, and a timer lets the player know how long they have been playing the game. To reset the game mid-play, click the restart icon in the top right corner of the screen.
